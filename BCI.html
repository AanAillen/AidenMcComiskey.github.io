									<h1>Transformer Model </b> BCI for Communucation</h1>

									<h2>Inspiration</h2>
									<p>When I was 12 years old, my uncle was diagonsed with Huntington's disease.  I watched him deal with the disease as it progressed;
										as he slowly lost his ability to move and eventually to communicate.  He tried to get access to a BCI in order to help restore his 
										communication skills, but unfortunately wasn't able to do so.  That really inspired me to 
										look into the field and try to help advance a field that can have such an immense impact
										on people's quality of life.  
									</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Research Overview</h2>
									<p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have transformed how we approach communication for 
										individuals with physical impairments. My research focused on leveraging transformer 
										models, originally designed for natural language processing, to decode 
										electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals into coherent text with a test accuracy of
										 95.5% in just 15 minutes of training.</p>
									<hr />
										<h2>Key Highlights</h2>
										<ol>
											<li><h5>High Accuracy with Limited Data</h5> Developed a transformer-based model capable of achieving a test accuracy of 95.5% on sentence decoding tasks. This performance rivals state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly less training data. </li>
											<li><h5> Enhanced Computing Effeciency</h5> Optimized the model to complete training in just 15 minutes and 25 epochs, demonstrating a 94% reduction in training time compared to traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) methods</li>
											<li><h5>Treated Neural Signals as a Human Language</h5> The reason I decided to use a transformer model was because we made the presumption that neural signals are fundamentally similar to human languages.  Using the unique capabilites of transformer architectures, we were able to analyze the ECoG signals as sequential data and did indeed demonstrate a fundamental similarity between neural signals and human language strucutre.</li>
										</ol>

									<h2>Impact and Applications</h2>
									This research opens doors to creating faster, more efficient BCIs for individuals with conditions like ALS, Huntington's disease, or severe paralysis. By translating thoughts into words, these systems can restore a vital aspect of human interactionâ€”communication.
