                                <h2>How It Began</h2>
                                <p>I first joined an underwater robotics club in middle school, focused on building and testing underwater ROVs.  The challenge?  We had no budget.  We used everything from old bilge pumps to kitchen tongs, and pieced together a mostly-functional robot.  I became really passionate about the project and wanted to take it further. In high school, I worked to get the club officially recognized as an academic course, which later became the school's most popular minor.</p>
                                <p>Leading a team of 10, I helped design and build an advanced UROV that competed at the <strong>MATE World Championships</strong> after succeeding in regionals.

                                <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
								As the team lead, I was chosen to act as the "company CEO", responsible for coordinating the team.  This involved dividing the team into groups, setting  milestones and deadlines to keep the project on track for regional and international competitions, and presenting our work to judges and industry professionals at competitions.<br>
								 However, my role wasn’t limited to leadership—I was deeply involved in the design and engineering of the UROV:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Frame Design:</strong> Created and 3D-printed the custom UROV frame, balancing hydrodynamics, weight, and structural integrity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Custom Thrusters:</strong> Designed and built thrusters optimized for precise underwater movement and efficiency.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Robotic Arm:</strong> Developed and implemented a generatively designed robotic arm, ensuring maximum strength while minimizing weight.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electronics and Integration:</strong> Supervised and integrated the power systems, control boards, and waterproofed connections.</li>
                                </ul>

                                        <p>Designe a 3D printed, lightweight, modular frame.  Each piece was printed from either PLA or our homemade PET filament (made from recycled water bottles).  Its modular design allows for quick attachment of components, and switching between a high-payload setup, and a lightweight, high-speed configuration.</p>
