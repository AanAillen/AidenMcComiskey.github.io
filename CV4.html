									<h1>Craniosacral Therapy<br />
									Device</h1>

										<h3> Why this project?</h3><br />
									<p> After I suffered a back injury a few years ago, I was very fortunate to meet
									<a href="https://www.jorgemanualtherapy.com/"><i>Jorge Fernandez</i></a>, an exceptional manual 
									therapist who helped me in my recovery.  He told me about an idea he had for a craniosacral therapy 
									device that he thought could make such treatments much more accesible but, due to his blindness, 
									was unable to develop it himself.  Thrilled to be able to help, I have been working side by side
									with him since then!</p>
									</article>

								<h2>What is the CV4 Machine?</h2> 
									<p> The CV4 machine is a device designed to provide targeted pressure to the cranial base, allowing therapists to administer CV4 therapy to patients with a more consitent outcome.  The device can also be used by patients themselves, giving them more flexibility over their treatment choices.</p>
									<h3>Key Features of the CV4</h3>
									<ol>
										<li><h5>Precision Design</h5> Engineered to replicate the manual techniques used by trained therapists. </li>
										<li><h5> Accessibility:</h5> Designed for at-home use, making craniosacral therapy available to a wider audience.</li>
									</ol>

							<h3>My Role in Development</h3>
							Working alongside Jorge, I have helped him bring his vision to life.  I created 3D models using Fusion 360 and produced functional prototypes with 3D printers to get a few working prototypes. After each prototype, Jorge and I would discuss potential improvments.  Then I created a handful of "beta" devices, fully equipped with electronics and motors.  
							Now Jorge is planning to use those version of the device with some of his clients to gather data on its effectivess and see if further refinment is possible.  Then, I will begin to scale production up to a commercial level and beign distrbuiting the device.   We aim to produce about 10,000 units to help improve the quality of life of thousands of people!
